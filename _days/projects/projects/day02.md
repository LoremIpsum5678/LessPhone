I had a burst of energy today and decided to go on a bike ride instead of spending time on the phone. I brought lunch to the lake and ate outdoors (which I realised â€” I should do way more often, despite being surprised by heavy rain later). During dinner, I missed listening to podcasts while eating, but overall, it was a good day. In the evening, I worked out and set up this blog.
