After a rough night, I expected a challenging day ahead. It seems like the phone becomes more tempting the more exhausted you are, doesn't it? Resisting the urge to listen to music while working was particularly difficult. However, the compulsion to use my phone wasn't as overwhelming as I had feared. I took a few walks throughout the day, and listening to music outside motivated me to get out. By evening, I no longer felt a strong desire to use the phone.
