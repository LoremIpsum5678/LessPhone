<p>Here are the rules I set for this challenge:
<br />
<br />1. Check social media and news only once per day.
<br />2. No other forms of entertainment on the phone.
<br />3. Use the phone only with clear intent.
<br />4. No music or podcasts, except during workouts and walks.
<br /><br />
I hope this mini-blog helps me stay focused and hold myself accountable.</p>
