								<span class="h2">Day 0 - Rules</span>
								<p><p>Here are the rules I set for this challenge:
<br />
<br />1. Check social media and news only once per day.
<br />2. No other forms of entertainment on the phone.
<br />3. Use the phone only with clear intent.
<br />4. No music or podcasts, except during workouts and walks.
<br /><br />
I hope this mini-blog helps me stay focused and hold myself accountable.</p>

							<div class="project-details">
								<span class="h2">Day 1</span>
								<p><p>The first day went smoothly, I felt motivated and inspired. For the first time in a long while, I found myself reading a physical book again. However, based on past experiences with similar (and often unsuccessful) challenges, it seems like the first day is always one of the easiest.</p>

								<p><p>I had a burst of energy today and decided to go on a bike ride instead of spending time on the phone. I brought lunch to the lake and ate outdoors (which I realised — I should do way more often, despite being surprised by heavy rain later). During dinner, I missed listening to podcasts while eating, but overall, it was a good day. In the evening, I worked out and set up this blog.</p>

								<span class="h2">Day 3</span>
								<p><p>After a rough night, I expected a challenging day ahead. It seems like the phone becomes more tempting the more exhausted you are, doesn’t it? Resisting the urge to listen to music while working was particularly difficult. However, the compulsion to use my phone wasn’t as overwhelming as I had feared. I took a few walks throughout the day, and listening to music outside motivated me to get out. By evening, I no longer felt a strong desire to use the phone.</p>
